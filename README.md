# ansible-playbooks
Collection of Ansible playbooks used in my homelab by AWX.

This repository will loosely follow the structure of Anible Galaxy to maintain a logical format.

Most of my applications are currently deployed as containers and managed via Portainer. However, in the future I intend on migrating towards Kubernetes. Because of this, these playbooks will mostly be for OS configuration.
